## ﻿Four of Swords  
### Vision of respite, where the spirit can find calm in silence

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, a vision appears within the shadowed alcove of an ancient sanctuary. Four swords are set into the stone walls, creating a quiet and protective enclosure. The air within the alcove is cool and still, untouched by the clamor of the outside world. In the center, a low stone slab rests, surrounded by wildflowers of various pastel shades. Light filters through a single opening above, illuminating the stone slab and casting a soft glow over the swords.

In this future, the card speaks of rest, recovery, and the need to find sanctuary. It symbolizes a time when the seeker must step back from struggles to regain clarity and inner peace. The four swords embedded in the walls represent protection, while the alcove suggests a safe space for reflection and renewal.

The Skull of Fate urges the seeker to honor this time of rest, to allow themselves the stillness needed to heal and restore their energy. The vision suggests that stepping back now will allow strength to return, preparing them to face what lies ahead with renewed focus and resilience.
