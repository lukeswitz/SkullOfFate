## Justice
### Vision of perfect equilibrium, where truth balances the scales of consequence.

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, you see a commanding figure seated between two pillars of contrasting stoneâ€”one light, one dark. Justice holds scales of burnished gold in one hand, their perfect balance maintained despite the constant shifting of their contents, which appear as swirling forms of light and shadow. In the other hand is raised a double-edged sword that catches and fractures light into pristine clarity. The figure's gaze is direct yet compassionate, seeing through all pretense to the essential truth beneath. The floor beneath the throne periodically becomes transparent, revealing the intricate roots of cause and effect stretching back through time, connecting all actions to their consequences in an unbroken web of accountability.

In this future, the card speaks of the universal principle of balance and the perfect objectivity that sees beyond emotional attachment or personal bias. It represents a time when situations must be evaluated with clear discernment, when decisions carry significant consequences, and when truth must take precedence over comfortable illusion. Justice symbolizes the natural law that ensures every action generates proportional effect, not as punishment but as the mathematical certainty of cosmic equilibrium.

The Skull of Fate urges the seeker to approach their circumstances with this same clarity and fairness. The vision suggests that current situations may be the direct result of past choices, and that present decisions will ripple forward with equal inevitability. This is a time to take full responsibility for your actions without excessive guilt or pride, to make decisions based on objective truth rather than momentary desire, and to recognize that authentic fairness requires both compassion and accountability. Remember that true justice is not cold but clarifying, revealing the path to restoration through the acknowledgment of what is rather than what we wish might be.
