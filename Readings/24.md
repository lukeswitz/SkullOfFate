Ten of Wands    
\#\#\# Vision of burdens carried and the weight of countless responsibility testing resolve.

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, a scene unfolds along a steep mountain path. The trail winds upward, and at the base of the path lies a massive bundle of ten staffs, bound together with thick rope. The staffs are heavy, their weight bending the earth beneath them as they are lifted onto broad shoulders. The climb ahead is long and treacherous, and the summit is obscured by haze, giving no indication of how far remains to be traveled. The figure carrying the staffs moves slowly, each step labored under the tremendous load, yet the staffs remain tightly bound, a symbol of commitments and responsibilities that cannot be set aside.

In this future, the card speaks of burdens, hard work, and the challenge of carrying great responsibility. It symbolizes a time when the weight of obligations may feel overwhelming, and progress seems slow or difficult. The staffs, bound together, represent a culmination of tasks or duties that have accumulated over time, creating a sense of heaviness. The obsecured summit coupled with the persistence of the laboring figure suggests that while the end may not be in sight, it is known that the final destination is head. 

The Skull of Fate urges the seeker to evaluate the burdens they carry and to determine which can be lightened or shared. The vision suggests that while the load may feel immense, the strength to carry it is within reach, but it also asks whether all burdens are necessary. Progress is possible, but only with careful balance between effort and self-care. The climb may be hard, but the summit holds the promise of relief and reward.
