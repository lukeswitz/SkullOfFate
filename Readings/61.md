## Wheel of Fortune
### Vision of cyclical destiny, where change turns upon the axis of cosmic law.

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, you see a massive wheel suspended in space, rotating slowly between earth and sky. The wheel's rim is inscribed with symbols from forgotten alphabets and ancient traditions, while its spokes shimmer with colors that exist beyond normal perception. Four beings occupy the corners of the vision: an eagle soaring above, a lion perched to one side, an ox standing firmly below, and an angel reading from an eternal book opposite. Upon the wheel itself, three figures move with its rotation—one ascending in triumph, one balanced precariously at the summit, and one descending into shadow. At the wheel's perfectly still center glows a luminous sigil that remains motionless regardless of the constant turning around it.

In this future, the card speaks of the inevitable cycles of existence and the hidden patterns governing apparent chance. It represents a significant turning point, where forces beyond personal control shift circumstances in unexpected directions. The Wheel symbolizes the greater cosmic order that moves through individual lives like thread through fabric, creating designs too vast to be perceived from any single perspective. This is fate not as predestination but as the natural consequence of universal principles operating across time.

The Skull of Fate encourages the seeker to recognize both the limitations and opportunities presented by this cosmic turning. The vision suggests that resistance to the wheel's motion creates suffering, while alignment with its revolution reveals the hidden blessings within apparent misfortune. This is a time to develop perspective on life's fluctuations, to remain centered when external circumstances shift, and to trust that even the most challenging descents contain the seeds of future ascension. Remember that while you cannot control the wheel's turning, you can choose how to move with its revolutions, finding grace in acceptance and wisdom in the recognition that nothing—neither joy nor sorrow—remains in the same position forever.
