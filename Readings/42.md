## Four of Pentacles
### Vision of security's paradox, where wealth both protects and imprisons.

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, you see a solitary figure seated atop a stone pedestal in a windswept plain. Four golden pentacles encircle them—one clutched tightly to their chest, another locked beneath their feet, and two more secured beneath their hands. The figure's knuckles are white with tension, their posture rigid and uncomfortable. Beyond the circle of pentacles, the landscape shifts between barren wasteland and fertile fields, as if unable to decide its nature. A high wall is slowly rising around the figure, stone by stone, though it's unclear whether the wall is being built to keep dangers out or to keep the figure in.

In this future, the card speaks of financial stability achieved at the cost of growth and connection. It represents a time when the desire for security has led to an attachment that restricts rather than protects. The four pentacles symbolize material wealth and accomplishment, yet their arrangement reveals how easily abundance can become a prison when held too tightly. There is a difference between prudent management and fearful hoarding—one builds a foundation, while the other constructs a cage.

The Skull of Fate urges the seeker to examine their relationship with material possessions and security. The vision suggests that true wealth flows when it is managed with a generous spirit rather than a fearful grip. Consider what you might be sacrificing in your pursuit of stability, and whether the walls you've built for protection have become barriers to opportunity and connection. Safety is valuable, but not at the expense of growth and joy.
