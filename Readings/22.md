  
## Eight of Wands    
### Vision of everything moving toward a destined path.

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, you are momentarily disoriented as a rapid motion unfolds before you. In the sky above an open plain, eight staffs streak through the air like arrows, their paths straight and true, each one lit with a faint glow as it cuts through the clouds. The land below rushes by in a blur as if the staffs are moving faster than the wind itself. The sky is clear, with nothing obstructing their flight, and in the distance, the horizon gleams with a golden light. The energy all around is palpable, as if the staffs are being drawn toward something inevitable, unstoppable, and full of promise.

In this future, the card speaks of acceleration, progress, and the swift unfolding of events. It signifies a time when things are moving quickly, and momentum is building toward an inevitable outcome. The staffs racing through the sky symbolize goals, ideas, or plans being set into motion, with nothing standing in their way. The clear skies suggest clarity and focus, while the glowing horizon represents the destination drawing near.

The Skull of Fate urges the seeker to embrace this momentum and trust in the forward motion. The vision suggests that now is the time for action and movement, with little room for hesitation. Events are aligning, and the path ahead is clear—move with purpose, and let the winds of change carry you toward your goal.
