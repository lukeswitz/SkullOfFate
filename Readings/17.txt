## Three of Wands  
### Vision of expanding horizons, exploration turning into mastery.


As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, a scene appears high on a cliffside, overlooking a vast sea. Three tall staffs are firmly planted into the ground, forming a triangular arch that stands strong against the sea breeze. Beyond the cliff, ships sail out into the open waters, their sails catching the wind as they venture toward distant lands. The horizon seemingly stretches endlessly, with islands and unknown shores just visible in the distance, bathed in the golden light of a setting sun. The air is filled with the sense of anticipation, of journeys begun and fortunes awaiting just beyond sight.


In this future, the card speaks of progress, expansion, and the realization of goals. It represents a time when plans are set in motion and the fruits of effort are beginning to take shape. The three staffs, standing firm on the cliff, symbolize the foundation of stability and vision, while the ships on the horizon represent new ventures, explorations, and the expansion of one’s reach into new territories.


The Skull of Fate urges the seeker to remain focused on their broader vision, as the steps they’ve taken are guiding them toward greater horizons. The vision suggests that while much has already been accomplished, the real journey is just beginning, and with it comes the promise of growth and discovery. Keep moving forward, as new opportunities lie just beyond the horizon.
