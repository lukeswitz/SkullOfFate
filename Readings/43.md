## Five of Pentacles
### Vision of hardship's shadow, where faith persists despite material loss.

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, you see two figures trudging through a bitter snowstorm, their forms hunched against the biting wind. One leans heavily on the other, injured or ill, their combined shadow stretching long behind them. Five pentacles made of stained glass are embedded in a stone wall they pass, glowing with warm light that seems to illuminate everything except the travelers themselves, who remain untouched by its radiance. Beyond the wall, the dim outline of a sanctuary can be seen, smoke rising from its chimney, yet the pair moves past without looking up, unaware of the shelter so near at hand. As they walk, tiny golden coins fall unnoticed from holes in their tattered pockets, disappearing beneath the gathering snow.

In this future, the card speaks of material hardship and the feelings of isolation that often accompany difficult times. It represents a period of struggle where support exists but may be overlooked due to pride, shame, or simple unawareness. The five illuminated pentacles suggest that even in moments of apparent scarcity, opportunity and assistance remain present for those willing to recognize and receive them. What appears as abandonment may in fact be a failure to perceive the resources still within reach.

The Skull of Fate encourages the seeker to look beyond immediate circumstances to find overlooked sources of help and healing. The vision reminds us that hardship, while painful, rarely travels aloneâ€”compassion and community often walk alongside it, waiting to be acknowledged. In times of difficulty, be willing to raise your eyes from the path and see the sanctuary that stands before you, for the warmth you seek may be only a doorway away.
