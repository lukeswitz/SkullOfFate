## Three of Pentacles
### Vision of earned mastery, collaboration forging lasting achievements.

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, you see the interior of a grand cathedral under construction. Three figures stand in conference beneath a stone arch: a craftsman with tools in hand, a nobleman holding architectural plans, and a robed cleric pointing upward. As they converse, their breath forms into tiny golden pentacles that drift upward, adhering to the unfinished stonework and transforming into intricate carvings. Where their gazes meet, the air shimmers with shared understanding. The cathedral grows more complete with each passing moment, stones settling into perfect position as if guided by invisible hands, the collective vision of the three manifesting in solid form before your eyes.

In this future, the card speaks of skilled cooperation and the recognition of individual talents united toward a common goal. It represents a time when your expertise will be acknowledged and valued by others, creating an opportunity for meaningful collaboration. The three figures symbolize the perfect balance of skill, vision, and purposeâ€”components essential for building something that will endure beyond a single lifetime. This is the manifestation of ideas into physical reality through dedicated workmanship and mutual respect.

The Skull of Fate encourages the seeker to take pride in their developing skills and to remain open to the contributions of others. The vision suggests that true mastery is not achieved in isolation, but through the harmonious exchange of knowledge and the willingness to both teach and learn. This is a time to recognize your growth while acknowledging the wisdom of those around you, creating a foundation for success that benefits all involved in its construction.
