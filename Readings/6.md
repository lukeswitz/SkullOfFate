\#\# Six of Cups  
\#\#\# Vision of forgotten promises, where memories flow like rivers through time.

As you gaze into the hollow eye sockets, you see two figures standing beside an old stone well at the heart of a deserted courtyard. Each holds a cup filled with water drawn from the well, their reflections shimmering faintly on the surface. Between them, four other cups rest on the edge of the well. Suddenly, a tremor shakes the ground, and four cups topple over, spilling water back into the well from whence it came. The cool liquid splashes across the surface and the cups tumble into the well, sending ripples through the figure's reflections as if stirring long-forgotten memories. The two figures exchange a glance, the weight of shared understanding passing between them, while the cups in their hands remain intact, their waters still.

In this future, the card speaks of shared memories, the comfort of familiar bonds, and the subtle ache of time’s passing. It symbolizes a moment when past experiences resurface, rekindling emotions and stirring connections that have long remained dormant. The water spilled from the fallen cups represents memories that flow unexpectedly, altering the present moment, while the upright cups are a reminder that not all has been lost; some bonds endure unchanged.

The Skull of Fate urges the seeker to find meaning in the memories that resurface, recognizing that the past can offer healing even if it arrives unbidden. The vision suggests that revisiting old promises or shared experiences can bring renewal, as long as one does not become lost in the echoes of what once was. Sometimes, the waters of the past are stirred to remind us of who we are and where we come from, guiding us to find peace in the present.
