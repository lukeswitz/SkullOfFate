## ﻿Two of Swords 
### Vision of choices weighed in stillness, where indecision clouds the way.

As you peer into the hollow eye sockets, a scene forms of a calm, moonlit lake. Two swords lie crossed upon the shore, their points embedded in the sand. Mist curls around the blades, and above, the sky is darkened by shifting clouds that obscure the moon’s light. The air is heavy with silence, and the surface of the water is still, as if the world itself is holding its breath. The swords lie in perfect balance, yet the fog around them grows thicker, making the distinction between them uncertain and blurred.

In this future, the card speaks of indecision, inner conflict, and the need for balanced reflection. It symbolizes a moment when two paths or choices weigh equally, creating a sense of paralysis. The crossed swords represent opposing options or ideas, while the fog suggests that clarity is difficult to grasp without deeper introspection.

The Skull of Fate urges the seeker to pause and consider both paths carefully, to look beyond the appearence of each option into its deeper implications. The vision suggests that clarity will come, but only if the seeker takes the time to silence the mind and trust their intuition. Sometimes, stillness reveals what action alone cannot.
